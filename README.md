### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use CSS grid layout, which is specific to mobile devices. I also learned how to change the color of SVGs using CSS.


### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to work more on sites where CSS grid is desirable.

### Useful resources

- [SVG Color](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to change the color of an SVG image. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
